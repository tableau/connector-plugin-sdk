To help get a head start on their connectors, we have provided several samples covering different types of connectors. These connectors are meant only as examples, and are provided as-is.

There are three types of samples:
- Components are examples of a single piece of a connector. We have component samples for dialects, scripts, and more.
- Plugins are fully-formed connectors that pass TDVT and our manual test suite. We provide examples of a ODBC and JDBC connector that connect to Postgres data sources.
- Scenarios are example connectors for specific scenarios, like extract-only connectors or connectors using delegation. Unlike plugins, these are not necessarily fully-formed, and have not been tested with TDVT or the manual test suite.
