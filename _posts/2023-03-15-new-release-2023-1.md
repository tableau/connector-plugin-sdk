abstract: "The master SDK branch now targets Tableau 2023.1. The Connector SDK for 2022.4 has released for those wishing to target that version."

On March 15, with the full release of Tableau 2023.1 we moved the latest version of the master branch to target Tableau 2023.1. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2022.4, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2022.4](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/releases/tag/tableau-2022.4) release.
