abstract: "The master SDK branch now targets Tableau 2023.3. The Connector SDK for 2023.2 has released for those wishing to target that version."

Following the release of Tableau 2023.2, the `master` branch of the repo now targets Tableau 2023.3. This means that the samples and connectors made with this version of the SDK may not work with older versions of Tableau. To develop against Tableau 2023.2, please download the [Tableau Connector SDK for Tableau 2023.2](https://github.com/tableau/connector-plugin-sdk/tree/tableau-2023.2) release.
