**Read the table**

Entry | Description 
-|- 
&ndash; | There is no default or recommended value for this capability. If you use this capability, you need to verify that the value you use is correct for your database.
? | You need to verify that the value you use is correct for your database.
**<span style="color:red">Red</span>** | The recommended value is different than the default value.

## Metadata

Capability | Description | Default | Recommended 
-|-|-|-
CAP_FAST_METADATA | Set to 'yes' if you have small to moderate size schemas. This capability controls whether Tableau should enumerate all of the objects immediately when you connect. Set the value to “yes” to enable this capability for better performance when creating new connections. Disable this capability to allow search for specific schemas or tables instead of retrieving all objects. You can search for all objects by using an empty string. | yes | yes 
CAP_QUERY_TOP_0_METADATA | Set to 'yes' if the datasource can handle a "TOP 0" request for retrieving metadata | no | **<span style="color:red">?</span>**    
CAP_QUERY_WHERE_FALSE_METADATA | Set to 'yes' if the datasource can handle a "WHERE \<false\>" predicate for retrieving metadata | &ndash; | **<span style="color:red">?</span>** 

## Temporary Tables

Capability | Description | Default | Recommended
-|-|-|-
CAP_CREATE_TEMP_TABLES | Set to 'yes' if Tableau can create temporary tables needed for certain complex or optimized queries. Set to 'no' if creating temporary tables is not supported.  See also: CAP_SELECT_INTO. | &ndash; | **<span style="color:red">?</span>**

CAP_ODBC_METADATA_STRING_LENGTH_UNKNOWN | Set to 'yes' to prevent Tableau from allocating memory based on the driver-reported string length, which may not be known or reported properly. Instead, Tableau will use a fixed-sized string length, and will reallocate as needed to handle string data that is too large for the fixed-size buffer. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_STRING_TRUST_OCTET_LENGTH | Set to 'yes' to use the octet length reported by the driver for strings instead of computing it from the number of characters. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_EXECUTED_QUERY | Set to 'yes' to prevent Tableau from executing a query as a means of reading metadata. While Tableau typically includes a row-limiting clause in such metadata queries (e.g., 'LIMIT', or 'WHERE 1=0'), this may not help when used with a Custom SQL connection for database systems with poor query optimizers. Note that this capability may prevent Tableau from determining the connection metadata properly. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_PREPARED_QUERY | Set to 'yes' to prevent Tableau from using a prepared query as a means of reading metadata. A prepared query is often the fastest way to accurately read metadata. However, not all database systems are capable of reporting metadata for a prepared query without actually executing the query. Note that certain metadata -- for example from connections using Custom SQL -- cannot be retrieved if this capability and CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_EXECUTED_QUERY are both set. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_READ_IDENTITY_COLUMNS | Set to 'no' to prevent reading identity column metadata | yes | yes 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_SELECT_STAR | Set to 'yes' to prevent reading metadata using a 'select *' query. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_SQLCOLUMNS_API | Set to 'yes' to prevent Tableau from using older, less accurate API for reading metadata from ODBC data sources. Setting this capability allows Tableau to read metadata by issuing a full 'select *' query, which is expensive but may enable connectivity for extremely limited or unstable data sources. | &ndash; | &ndash; 
CAP_ODBC_METADATA_SUPPRESS_SQLFOREIGNKEYS_API | Set to 'yes' to prevent Tableau from attempting to read metadata describing foreign key constraints.
